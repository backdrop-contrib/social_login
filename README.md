Module:  OneAll Social Login
============================

Description
-----------

Professionally developed and free Backdrop module that allows your users to
register and login to your Backcdrop website with their existing social network
account (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google ...)

Your existing users can furthermore link their regular account to one or more
social networks or identity providers and can then use these social network
accounts to login without having to remember another username/password
combination.

SocialLogin helps increasing your user registration rate by simplifying the
registration process and provides permission-based social data retrieved from
the social network profiles.

SocialLogin integrates with your existing registration system so you and your
users don't have to start from scratch.

SocialLogin was originally written by OneAll, a technology company offering a set of
web-delivered tools and services for establishing and optimizing a site's
connection with social networks.

Social network APIs are constantly changing and being updated. OneAll monitors
these changes and automatically updates APIs, so you can be sure Social Login
will always run smoothly and with the most up-to-date API calls.
